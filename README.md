# ML-BankChurnModels
Customer Churn Prediction in the Banking Industry

Customer churn in the banking industry occurs when customers discontinue their relationship with a bank. When customers stop using the products and services offered by banks, it directly affects revenue, profits, and growth strategies. By reducing churn, banks can improve revenue streams, mitigate operational and reputational risks, and maintain a competitive advantage.

### Project Overview
This project explores how machine learning algorithms can predict customer attrition in the banking industry. The project will analyze churn using machine learning models, including:
- Random Forest
- Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Logistic Regression
  
### Data and Predictors  
Key predictors for churn include:  
- **Credit score**  
- **Gender**  
- **Age**  
- **Tenure**  
- **Account balance**  
- **Number of products**  
- **Geography**  
- **Is Active Member**  
- **Credit Card Ownership**  
- **Estimated salary**
  
The target variable for the study will be:  
- **Customer exit status (exited feature)**  

### Approach
Data Preprocessing: Address data quality issues, handle missing values, and manage class imbalances using Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE).
Model Evaluation: Models will be evaluated using key performance metrics:
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-Score**
- **ROC-AUC**

Optimization:
- **Hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation techniques was be applied to enhance model performance.**
- 

### Goal
By implementing robust models, banks can better understand the drivers of customer churn, develop effective retention strategies, and mitigate attrition risks.
